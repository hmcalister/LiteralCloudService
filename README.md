# LiteralCloudService Image Getter

This is the incredibly janky scripts used to get images from static webcams for my "cloud service", where images of clouds are emailed to a list of addresses daily. 

In the past, this repository also included functionality to send the emails with cloud images attached, but this functionality has shifted to other implementations and has been removed to avoid confusion. The old version of this repository can still be found in the `legacyImplementation` branch.
